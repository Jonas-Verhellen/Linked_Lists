# linked_lists

"At the opposite end of the spectrum, I actually wish more people understood the really core low-level kind of coding. Not big, complex stuff like the lockless name lookup, but simply good use of pointers-to-pointers etc. For example, I’ve seen too many people who delete a singly-linked list entry by keeping track of the “prev” entry, [...] and whenever I see code like that, I just go "This person doesn't understand pointers". And it's sadly quite common." - Linus Torvalds

This repo contains two implementations of a simply linked list inspired by the above Linus quote, one using pointers and one using pointers-to-pointers. The latter implementation being markedly more elegant.
